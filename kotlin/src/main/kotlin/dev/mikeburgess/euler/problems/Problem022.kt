/**
 * Problem 22
 *
 * Using a text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
 * alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by
 * its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
 *
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth
 * 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of
 * 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 *
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
